# page-poller

A simple Node.js script that polls a website and alerts when there's a change. This is easier on the CPU than a page refresher because it doesn't have to render the page.

This can be used for any website by setting the `--url` option. It strips csrf tokens and shopify tokens, which are supposed to change on every refresh, but I haven't anticipated everything like this. I may add functionality to select certain parts of a page to check for changes, but for now it just checks whole pages.

I originally built this for myself to poll PAX sites to alert me when badges were available, and the `--pax` option is still there for that purpose.

When there's a change, the script will stop polling, print a diff to the command line, and send a desktop notification.
